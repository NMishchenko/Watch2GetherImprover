# Watch2Gether Improver
The script for w2g.tv allows switching to/from bordered fullscreen, using some hotkeys inside YouTube fullscreen mode, and other features.<br />
For use as a userscript in TamperMonkey, Greasemonkey, etc.

# Improvements
* Added activation or deactivation bordered fullscreen by pressing the Num+ key (can be changed).
* Added Space, Arrow Left, and Arrow Right hotkeys inside YouTube fullscreen mode to control w2g playback inside the YouTube player.
* Disabled click on YouTube embed to pause YouTube playback instead of W2G.
* Fixed the defect with the hidden YouTube title bar in Firefox.
* Removed the "Popular Videos" section.

# Post Scriptum
This script was made for personal use and published to demonstrate the possibilities of improving the user experience for the website.<br />
The code was written just to achieve the result with little or no use of some best coding practices.
